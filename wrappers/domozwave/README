Getting DomotiGa's open-zwave support to work is a 2 step process.

1. Build the open-zwave project.
2. Build the DomoZWave wrapper.

1. Building open-zwave

Install needed development headers: (for Ubuntu Maverick)
$ sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libxmlrpc-core-c3-dev

Download latest open-zwave code like this:, you need rev 242 or higher!
$ cd ~/install
$ svn co http://open-zwave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-zwave-read-only
$ cd open-zwave-read-only/cpp/build/linux

Compile open-zwave code:
$ make

2. Building DomoZWave wrapper

$ cd ~/domotiga/wrappers/domozwave
$ ln -s ~/install/open-zwave-read-only ./open-zwave
$ make
$ sudo make install

Restart DomotiGa

Enable open-zwave option under ZWave settings.
During first run there is a logfile name 'OZW_Log.txt' and a open-zwave status
file named 'zwcfg_<homeid>.xml' created in ~/domotiga/wrappers/domozwave

To Do:
Add option to enable poll timer.
Gather more information of discovered devices (version, neighbor, etc)

Known Bugs:
When restarted after open-zwave settings changed, DomotiGa crashes, possible due to a bug in open-zwave, must be fixed.
Error: gbx2: ../../src/Options.cpp:306: bool OpenZWave::Options::Lock(): Assertion `0' failed.


A very big thank you to Jaren, thanks for building and sharing this code!
