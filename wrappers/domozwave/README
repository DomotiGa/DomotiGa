Getting DomotiGa's open-zwave support to work is a 2 step process.

1. Build the open-zwave project.
2. Build the DomoZWave wrapper.

===

1. Building open-zwave

Install needed libraries:
$ sudo apt-get install subversion libudev-dev libjson0 libjson0-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev

Download latest open-zwave code like this:, you need rev 570 or higher!
$ cd ~/install
$ svn co http://open-zwave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-zwave-read-only
$ cd open-zwave-read-only

Compile open-zwave code:
$ make

===

2. Building DomoZWave wrapper

$ cd ~/domotiga/wrappers/domozwave
$ ln -s ~/install/open-zwave-read-only ./open-zwave
$ make
$ sudo make install

===

Restart DomotiGa

===

Enable open-zwave option under Z-Wave => Open Z-Wave settings.
During first run there is a logfile name 'OZW_Log.txt' and a open-zwave status
file named 'zwcfg_<homeid>.xml' created in ~/domotiga/wrappers/domozwave

===

TODO:
- Only allow available assocations
- Thermostat/climate support
- Scenes

Special thanks to Jaren for creating the wrapper and Alexie for updating it.
