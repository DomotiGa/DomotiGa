Important Notice:

This is a first step in porting DomotiGaServer to Gambas3, the development version.
It's very experimental, you can't even call it in Alpha stage.

Because of the differences in syntax and changes to the Gambas components I had to
make a seperate version.
See this wiki entry for more information about porting to Gambas3.
http://www.domotiga.nl/wiki/Gambas/Gambas3

At some point I will do the same for the DomotiGa GUI client.
Some bugs still exists, UDP broadcasts are not working for example.

So it's not suitable for production yet, but please test it and give feedback so when
Gambas3 becomes stable we are ready to use it.

Regards,
Ron.
