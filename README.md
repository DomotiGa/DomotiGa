DomotiGa - Open Source Home Automation for Linux
================================================

Thank you for your interest in DomotiGa!
DomotiGa is Home Automation software for Linux written in [Gambas Basic](http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html), an excellent programming language and IDE for Linux.

DomotiGa has grown over the years from a tool to monitor sensors with via RFXCom interface, but nowadays you can use it to read and log data from all kind of interfaces, let it detect motion and schedule lights or appliances at certain times.
Or get events triggered by actions of other hardware and/or software modules, called 'plugins'.
Sending push messages via Twitter, Pushbullet, Pushover and NMA are also possible.

DomotiGa supports a long and growing [list](https://domotiga.nl/projects/domotiga/wiki/Modules) of various plugins to support for example the versatile RFXComTRX transceiver, a Razberry board on your Pi or the AEON Labs Open-Zwave dongle, Smartmeter P1 port, Plugwise dongle and more...

Requirements
------------

Depends on which setup U want to use (see below) you want to use, but minimum is Gambas 3.6.0 for the server/client GUI.
To use one of the web clients you need to install a webserver like nginx or Apache, with PHP.

Clients and Server
------------------

You have a few choices on how you want DomotiGa to setup:

* Standalone
You can have a standlone GUI (DomotiGa3) as server and client.
You do this by setting the Mode to 'server' in the config file.
This is the default and will talk to all enabled hardware.
You need server hardware with XWindows installed with a monitor or working VNC setup.

* GUI client(s) and CLI server
You can run the DomotiGaServer3 as server to talk to the hardware and DomotiGa3 as
clients, you have to change the Mode parameter in domotiga.conf from
server to client on the machines you run DomotiGa3 on.

* GUI client(s) and GUI server
You can use the standalone version as server, but with more DomotiGa instances as clients.
So you configure on with server as Mode parameter, and the others as client, make sure the mysql host, xmlrpc and udp broadcast settings are set correctly for this.

* Web client(s)
On low performance hardware is often better to only run the CLI server (DomotiGaServer3)
Together with nginx or Apache as webserver and DomotiYii as the webclient.

DomotiYii is still under development, so if it doesn't do what you want right now, give us a poke!

Hardware
--------

Gambas and thus DomotiGa can run on a variety of server hardware, read more info [here](https://domotiga.nl/projects/domotiga/wiki/DomotiGa_Server_Hardware)
Popular are the Cubieboard 2 or Cubietruck (with SSD), for a very small/test setup the Rasberry Pi can just handle it.
