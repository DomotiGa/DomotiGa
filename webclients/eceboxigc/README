This webclient is made by four students of ece.fr.
They did a nice job, and hereby my thanks to Sylvain, Romain and the other students!

I translated it to English, renamed the files to more logical names, 
renamed some XMLRPC methods so they fit the others, and replaced/extended the menu icons.

Regards,
Ron.

How to install the ECEBoxIGC web client Step by Step: 

1)
If not done already Download and install DomotiGa following the steps described here:
http://domotiga.nl/projects/domotiga/wiki/Installation
Note: this webclient only works with XMLRPC 0.17 and higher, this implies running DomotiGa3 and/or DomotiGaServer3.

2) 
Install and configure Apache HTTP server using the information here:
http://www.domotiga.nl/projects/domotiga/wiki/Install_Optional
Install php-mysql dbo component.

$ sudo apt-get install php5-mysql

3) 
Create the eceboxigc database using the supplied eceboxigc.sql file.
Goto to the directory containing the file and run:

$ mysql -u root -p <./eceboxigc.sql

This database hold the configuration of the tabs and widgets.
Maybe later this information will be intergrated with domotiga's database.

4) 
Copy the www folder or it's contents somewhere inside your Apache directory.
$ sudo cp -r www /var/www/eceboxigc
You can then access them by appending /eceboxigc to the url.

Or if you want the files in your www root:
$ sudo cp -r www/* /var/www

5)
Examine the config.php.example, change it to your needs and rename it to config.php
$ sudo mv config.php.example config.php

Some settings explained:

$rpc_connect
Is the url to connect to DomotiGa's xmlrpc server.
If DomotiGa and the the webserver run on same machine
there is no need to change it.

$db_*
These variables hold the connection to the database.
No need to change it if your run your mysql server on same machine
and imported the eceboxigc.sql file like described above.

$weatherID
This ID is used on the weather page, this page uses Yahoo weather service.
If you want to find out the ID for your location do this:
Go to http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast, fill in your location
as detailed as possible.
Click Go and look for the number used in the url, this is your id.

6)
For the graphs to work you need to make a symbolic link bewteen your domotiga's graphs directory
and apache www dir.

$ sudo ln -s /home/<user>/domotiga/rrd/graphs /var/www/graphs

it should look something like this
$ ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   30 apr 16 19:16 graphs -> /home/ron/domotiga/rrd/graphs/

7)
Start DomotiGa3 in server mode, or DomotiGaServer3.

8) ECEBoxIGC is ready to use!

Browse to http://localhost/eceboxigc

Click on the Init button, to load a few default menu entries (to be changed)
Add or modify menu entries by clicking on + button, delete by clicking on -
You can add widgets to the Dashboard by clicking on right + button next to it.
Optional to make it password secured:
A) Configure your password access

$ sudo htpasswd -c /var/users ECEBoxIGCuser
$ cp htaccess.example .htaccess

Configure Apache to use the .htaccess file
TBD.

Please report any problems, and submit your enhancements and ideas ;-)
