DomotiGa's TODO list:

[General]
* Create class for devices and events, so they are kept and update in memory, saved to db at regular intervals and on exit.
* Create documentation and integrate help function.

[X10]
* Implement Extended Dim command.

[SerialPort Monitor]
* Expand it so you see double used/assigned ports, and display graphical links between them.

[RFXComRX]
* Add support for more than one interface.

[RFXComTX]
* Add support for more than one interface.

[Events]
* Fix bug where Conditions don't work like Dark=TRUE.
* Expand Trigger types, and expand Run commands.

[Plugwise]
* Set values to ?? if Plugwise is enable and a defined Plug is not found. This creates the needed NaN in RRDTool graphs.
* Write debug message to log when there are no enabled Plugs devices found with Plugwise enabled.

[Web Interface]
* Add TrayIcon mode to DomotiGa, so it can run in server mode, remove GUI ballast if needed.

[TrackMe]
* Integrate TrackMe database tables and fields into Domotiga's database, make this part of new web interface.

[Devices]
* Add all supported types/modules to the database so we can keep an inventory.
* Make it easier to search for/select a devicetype when adding new device.
* Create reports so you have a hardware inventory list.
