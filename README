DISCLAIMER:
DomotiGa comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Make sure you have read the LICENSE file (or the About window contents),
if you do not agree with it please remove this program from your computer.

How to get DomotiGa up and running:

Login as the user you want to run DomotiGa as.
Unpack this archive, I guess you already did...

Move/Copy it to the home dir of the user account which is going to run DomotiGa (no root!)
Check permissions most of the dirs need to be writeable by the user.

So you have for example:
/home/ron/domotiga

Inside you will find this:

README           - you are reading it now
CHANGELOG        - some notes about changes between versions
LICENSE          - the GPL license
AUTHORS          - the author(s)

<dir> DomotiGa   - the Gambas source code
<dir> rrd        - rrd databases and graphs are stored here
<dir> logs       - this is where DomotiGa stores it's logfiles
<dir> icons      - icons used for devices
<dir> floorplans - store your floorplan images here
<dir> tvguide    - directory for xml tvguide related files
<dir> sounds     - sounds to play
<dir> www        - some webserver related stuff (work in progress)

domotiga.gambas  - the executable
domotiga.conf    - database config settings (the rest are stored inside the database)
domotiga.sql     - example database layout and contents
user.sql         - sql code to grant database user


You need a working Gambas environment, either runtime, or development.
Gambas should be version 2.9 or later (not yet tested with 3.0 development branch)
Preferably latest available code from svn.

Look on the website for an how to http://domotiga.nl

Next step, you need to setup an MySQL database for Domotiga.
I have supplied an SQL dump in this directory.

You can import it like so:

$ cd ~/domotiga
$ mysql -u root -p <yourmysqladminpassword> < domotiga.sql

You also need to import a db user:

$ mysql -u root -p <yourmysqladminpassword> < user.sql

Note: if you decide to change the default db user and/or password, you have to edit
domotiga.conf too.

If you already have an older version of DomotiGa running import the db upgrade sql

$ mysql -u root -p <yourmysqladminpassword> < upgrade.sql

Create shortcut on Desktop

Right click op desktop or goto menu editor (in Preferences on Ubuntu)
New item;
Name: DomotiGa
Command: /home/<youruser>/domotiga/domotiga.gambas
Icon: /home/<youruser>/domotiga/icons/logo.png

If you want to look/change the source code, start the Gambas's IDE by clicking the icon, or
typing gambas2 inside a terminal window.

Then select open project and browse to ~/domotiga/DomotiGa

If you want to start DomotiGa with editor click on icon to start DomotiGa.

If Authentication is enabled (menu Setup->Main) you can login with:

User: admin
Password: admin
Can create, edit and view.

User: user
Password: user
Can only view.

You can add or change user logins under menu Edit->Users


=============================================================================================

NOTES:
I repeat; The user you run DomotiGa as should NOT be 'root'!
It's too much of a security risk.
Use a normal user account with limited privileges.

Make sure that your user account has enough permissions to read from/write to your serial
ports and run commands needed for DomotiGa, like for example; hcitool (bluetooth) and rrdtool
(for graphing) etc.

Add the user to the group 'dialin' for serial port access if not already done.
All hardware and software modules are disabled by default, goto the Setup menu to
Configure and Enable them.
Read the docs on the website for more information about these modules.
(ahum, I'm still writing them LOL)
If thinks don't work enable debug information for this module and examine debug log.

If you get this when you switch program language to Dutch:
WARNING: cannot switch to language 'nl_NL.UTF-8'. Did you install the corresponding locale?

$ sudo apt-get install language-pack-nl-base

=============================================================================================
