DISCLAIMER:
DomotiGa comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

Make sure you have read the license file called COPYING, or the programs About
window contents.
If you do not agree with it please remove this program from your computer.

How to get DomotiGa up and running:

Login as the user you want to run DomotiGa as.
Unpack this archive, I guess you already did ...

Move/Copy it to the home dir of the user account which is going to run DomotiGa
(no root!)
Check permissions/ownership of the dirs DomotiGa, tvguide, rrd and logs need to
be writeable by the user.

So you have for example:
/home/ron/domotiga

Inside you will find this:

README              - you are reading it now
CHANGELOG           - some notes about changes between versions
COPYING             - the GPL license
AUTHORS             - the author(s)

<dir> DomotiGa      - the Gambas source code
<dir> rrd           - rrd databases and graphs are stored here
<dir> logs          - this is where DomotiGa stores it's logfiles
<dir> icons         - icons used for devices
<dir> install       - files needed for fresh database install
       domotiga.sql - example database layout and contents
       user.sql     - sql code to grant database user
<dir> floorplans    - store your floorplan images here
<dir> tvguide       - directory for xml tvguide related files
<dir> upgrade       - files needed for upgrading database version
<dir> sounds        - sounds to play
<dir> www           - some webserver related stuff (work in progress)

domotiga.gambas     - the executable
domotiga.conf       - database config settings
(the rest are stored inside the database)

You need a working Gambas environment, either runtime, or development.
Gambas should be version 2.13.1 or later.
Preferably latest available stable code from svn.

Look on the website for an how to http://domotiga.nl

Next step, you need to setup an MySQL database for Domotiga.
I have supplied an SQL dump called domotiga.sql.

You can import it like so:

$ cd ~/domotiga
$ mysql -u root -p <yourmysqladminpassword> < install/domotiga.sql

Note: if you decide to change the default db user and/or password,
you have to edit domotiga.conf too.

If you already have an older version of DomotiGa running, import
the db upgrade sql scripts.

$ mysql -u root -p <yourmysqladminpassword> < upgrade/xxxtoyyy.sql
Where xxx = current DomotiGa version and yyy is new version.

Create shortcut on Desktop

Right click on desktop and create laucher or goto menu editor
(in Preferences on Ubuntu)

New item
Name: DomotiGa
Command: /home/<youruser>/domotiga/domotiga.gambas
Icon: /home/<youruser>/domotiga/icons/logo.png

If you want to look/change the source code, start the Gambas's IDE
by clicking the icon, or type gambas2 inside a terminal window.

Then select open project and browse to ~/domotiga/DomotiGa

If you want to start DomotiGa from within editor click on icon
to start DomotiGa.

If Authentication is enabled (menu Setup->Main) you can login with:

User: admin
Password: admin
Can create, edit and view.

User: user
Password: user
Can only view.

You can add or change user logins under menu Edit->Users

================================================================================

NOTES:
I repeat; The user you run DomotiGa as should NOT be 'root'!
It's too much of a security risk.
Use a normal user account with limited privileges.

Make sure that your user account has enough permissions to read
from/write to your serial ports and run commands needed for DomotiGa,
like for example; hcitool (bluetooth) and rrdtool (for graphing) etc.

Add the user to the group 'dialin' for serial port access if not already done.
All hardware and software modules are disabled by default, goto the
Setup menu to configure and enable them.

Read the docs on the website for more information.

If things don't work enable debug information for this module and
examine debug log.

If you get this error when you switch program language to Dutch:
WARNING: cannot switch to language 'nl_NL.UTF-8'.
Did you install the corresponding locale?

$ sudo apt-get install language-pack-nl-base

================================================================================

If you want your home automation hardware to be supported, you can donate it,
or send me the specs or both and I see what I can do. ;-)
